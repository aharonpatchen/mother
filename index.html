            <h2> God made a wonderful mother</h2>
            <h3> A mother who never grows old;</h3>
            <h4> He made her smile of the sunshine,</h4>
            <h5> And He molded her heart of pure gold;</h5>
            <h6> In her eye He placed bright shining stars,</h6>
            <h7> In her cheeks fair roses you see;<h7>
            <h8> God made a wonderful mother,</h8>
            <h9> And He gave that dear mother to me.</h9>
