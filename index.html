            <br>God made a wonderful mother<br>
            
            <br>A mother who never grows old;<br>
            
            <br>He made her smile of the sunshine,<br>
            
            <br>And He molded her heart of pure gold;<br>
            
            <br>In her eye He placed bright shining stars,<br>
            
            <br>In her cheeks fair roses you see;<br>
            
            <br>God made a wonderful mother,<br>
            
            <br>And He gave that dear mother to me<br>.</h2>
